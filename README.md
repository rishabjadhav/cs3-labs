# cs3-projects
This repository contains my Java projects from Computer Science 3 (CS3) during the 2021-2022 school year. In CS3, I learned more advanced Java topics such as data structures and algorithms that improved my understanding of the Java programming language and prepared me for future computer science education.



Course Description:

This course continues the study of computer programming using Java. Students must have mastered the topics in AP Computer Science A. This mastery is needed because this course is a study of classic data structures including linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, priority queues, and their application to algorithms such as quick-sort and heap-sort. Students will also be introduced to graph theory and extend their knowledge of recursive algorithms. Other topics may be included, such as advanced GUI techniques, multi-threaded programs, networked applications, and number theory. Students in this course will receive the same weighted GPA as all AP Courses.
